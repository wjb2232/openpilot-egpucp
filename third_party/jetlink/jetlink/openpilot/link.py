Opening the link over what the owner lends, and making the Jetson ready to
run the model that is picked.

Both borrowers of the link do this. A provisioning run does it offroad, where
it can spend minutes downloading a gigabyte; modeld's join thread does it
onroad, where it cannot download but can upload a file the comma already has
and then wait out the build with the small model driving. What they share is
here: the lease and the client on it, the model's identity, the upload nobody
may make without proving the hash first, and the record of what the server
ended up with.
