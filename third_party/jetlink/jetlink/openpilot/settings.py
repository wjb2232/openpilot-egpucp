The two settings every jetlink process reads, straight off openpilot's params
files: the Accelerator Link setting and whether the car is parked.

The owner cannot construct openpilot's Params: it imports swaglog, which costs
28 MB and brings numpy, capnp and zmq with it. So the fork's adapter says where
the store is and what the keys are called (OwnerConfig), and this reads the
files. params.cc writes a value to a temporary file, fsyncs it and renames it
over the key, so a plain read gets the old value or the new one and never a
torn one. The byte format is params.cc's put: b"1" or b"0" for a BOOL,
decimal ASCII for an INT. The fork's tests write with the real Params and read
back through here, so a change on either side fails there.

Every other process reads these two the same way, so they agree with the owner;
JSON values go through the adapter's get and put, which are the real Params.

The standard library only: the owner imports this module.
