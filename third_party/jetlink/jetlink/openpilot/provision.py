One provisioning run: `python -m jetlink.openpilot.provision --adapter MODULE`.

The heavy half of jetlink, numpy and the client, which is why it is a run and
not a daemon. The owner (jetlink.openpilot.owner, as jetlinkd) holds the gadget
for the whole time the link is enabled and starts a run when something
changes; the run borrows the endpoint files from it exactly as modeld does
(jetlink.comma.lending), so the gadget never leaves the bus and a parked car
keeps one resident jetlink process of about 13 MB instead of a run's 47. Only
the owner ever holds ep0: a run that gets no loan logs it and exits, and the
owner starts another.

The result is cached on the Jetson, recorded in the spec record and left
loaded on the server. The owner stops a run at the onroad transition with
SIGTERM, so every long wait polls `stop`; the server's build thread carries on
regardless and modeld picks the engine up over its own link.

What the owner cannot learn for itself it hears from the run: the server's
hello, passed on over the loan (lending.Loan.note_server), and whether the
round left work undone, which is the exit status: 0 when nothing is left,
anything else to be tried again once the owner's backoff has passed.
