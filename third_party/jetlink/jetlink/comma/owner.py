Holds the USB gadget, and nothing else.

The comma is the USB device: the link exists only while some process holds ep0
with the UDC bound. This is that process, for as long as the link is enabled,
onroad and offroad alike, and no other process ever holds ep0. Whoever wants
to move bytes borrows the endpoint files over a unix socket (lending.py) and
the gadget never leaves the bus.

The Accelerator Link setting names the host. For USB (a Jetson or a Mac) the
gadget is FunctionFS alone and the endpoint files are lent at once. For iOS
the gadget is composite: the phone is on its network interface and dials this
process (lending.CableListener), and the loan carries its socket; the endpoint
files are never lent, and the gadget is never released, settled or bounced,
since every unbind drops the phone's network interface with it.

It is deliberately small. Everything heavy jetlink does is episodic, so none of
it lives here: a download, an upload and a TensorRT build all belong to the
provisioning run (jetlink.openpilot.provision), which this spawns when there is
something to do and which exits when there is not. That keeps a parked car and
a drive alike at one resident jetlink process of about 13 MB rather than
47.5 MB, and it is why nothing in this module may import swaglog, Params,
numpy, capnp or zmq; see gadget.py and tests/test_comma_gadget.py. The caller
names the worker and hands over the settings: jetlink.openpilot.owner makes
and runs the Owner from what the fork's adapter says (OwnerConfig), so nothing
here knows an openpilot module or a param name.

What it knows, it writes down whole every step in its status record
(gadget.STATUS): the gadget, the host, presence with its hold, the errors. The
UI and hardwared read that one file rather than the gadget's own files one by
one, and its timestamp is the heartbeat that tells them the owner is gone.

manager stops this on shutdown with SIGINT and SIGKILLs it 5 s later, so every
long wait polls `stop`: a FunctionFS owner killed mid-transfer leaves the
gadget in a state only a reboot clears.
