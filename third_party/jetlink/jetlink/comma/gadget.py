The comma's USB gadget, and how to look at it, using nothing but the
standard library and jetlink's own transport.

Kept apart from openpilot so the process that owns the gadget can be small.
Holding ep0 needs sysfs and a unix socket; `openpilot.common.swaglog` costs
28 MB because it drags numpy, capnp and zmq in to publish a log line, and
`openpilot.common.params` imports swaglog, so a module that touches either
prices the owner out of being minimal. Measured on the comma: python plus this
plus the FunctionFS transport is 10.4 MB against 47.5 MB for the daemon that
imported the world.

Nothing in jetlink.comma may import openpilot or knows a param: the settings
come from jetlink.openpilot.settings, over the directory and the keys the
fork's adapter names. tests/test_comma_gadget.py holds the line.

jetlink.openpilot's heavy processes import it too, and bind() points `log` at
the fork's cloudlog (set_logger), so their lines still reach the drive's log
while the owner's go to a file.

# also runs the DHCP server), and the phone dials CABLE_ADDR whenever it holds

# writes to the endpoint files, which a phone never reads. The setting, not a
# guess, says which: a hello over FunctionFS to a phone blocks 15 s and bounces
# the gadget, and waiting to see whether a phone dials cost every Jetson
# reconnect 5 to 10 s.
