"""Fork-side runtime patches for the USB-eGPU stack.

These patches used to live inside upstream files (modeld.py, usbgpu.py,
compile_modeld.py, precompiled_model.py, helpers.py). They are collected here so those
files stay upstream's, and so every process that needs them gets them from one place: the
repo-root ``sitecustomize.py`` imports and applies this module at interpreter start
(see that file for why the hook works for manager-spawned processes, the precompiled
worker subprocess and the ``check_usbgpu`` probe alike).

What is patched, and why the patches are needed at all:

* ``AM_POWER_LIMIT``: the chestnut (ASM24) board defaults to the GPU's SMU PPT limit
  (~182W). 120W lowers the peak current and cuts USB/PCIe link flapping under load,
  which showed up as ``bulk IN`` I/O errors mid-inference. tinygrad's amdev reads it.
* ``tinygrad.helpers.fetch_fw``: tinygrad only looks for AMD firmware in
  ``/lib/firmware`` and otherwise downloads it from gitlab. That directory holds a
  different linux-firmware build than the one tinygrad pins, the download is blocked
  (HTTP 403), and the failed init then disables the eGPU. Also search the persistent
  dir ``firmware.ensure_firmware()`` fills and the blobs shipped in-tree for this board.
* ``precompiled_model.record_failure``: a dropped bulk transfer or a lost USB lock race
  is a property of the link, not of the artifact. Judging those permanent blacklisted
  healthy precompiled artifacts until someone deleted the marker by hand.
* ``helpers.active_usbgpu_compiled_path`` / ``usbgpu_compile_pending``: upstream resolves
  "precompiled first, chunked second", so pinning the precompiled package in the web UI
  silently resolved to the chunked artifact whenever the precompiled one was missing or
  rejected - the page said one delivery while the car drove the other. Under that pin the
  two functions answer for the precompiled artifact only (see patch_model_delivery).

Rules for anything added here:

* never import the modules being patched at startup - use ``patch_after_import()``. A
  process that never touches tinygrad must not pay for it, and modeld must keep setting
  ``GMMU`` before its first tinygrad import;
* one patch per concern, idempotent, and silent on failure: this module runs in every
  python process on the device and must never be able to break one;
* ``OPENPILOT_EGPU_PATCH=0`` disables everything.
