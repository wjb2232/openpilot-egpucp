"""Where the big model and its precompiled artifacts are served from.

Kept in its own file so switching mirrors does not require touching big_model.py:
only this one small module changes.

precompiled.json and firmware/amdgpu are resolved relative to the model URL (see
precompiled_model.ensure_precompiled / firmware.ensure_firmware), so keep the
model file inside <base>/models/.

This module is fork-only: big_model.py only calls pinned_manifest() at the top of
fetch_manifest(). Keep it that way, so a merge cannot conflict on the pin.

Known intentional divergences in upstream files (all "plain http mirror" relaxations,
deletable once the mirror serves TLS, and all greppable by `not in ("http", "https")`):
  * big_model.BigModelManifest.from_dict  - accepts http as well as https
  * big_model.wait_for_manifest_network   - accepts http, and defaults the port by scheme
  * precompiled_model.validate_catalog    - accepts http artifacts on the catalog origin
